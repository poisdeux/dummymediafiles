EXTD=If you are a fan of Bradley, Sublime, or just appreciate quality music,
EXTD=\nyou will be stoked to hear this. Brad touched many people, and it is 
EXTD=a shame that \nhe is not here to realize his greater impact. Brad never
EXTD= seemed more alive than he\ndid behind a mic, and on those occasions wh
EXTD=en he, Bud and Eric got in front of a \ncrowd, some of us never felt mo
EXTD=re alive either.\n\nShortly after "Date Rape" blew up, Brad was to play
EXTD= an acoustic set, solo at\nCattlemen's Wharf in Anaheim. Tom from No Do
EXTD=ubt put on shows there\nat the bar upstairs called the Firecracker Loun
EXTD=ge. The room was dark and \npacked, lit by white Christmas lights drape
EXTD=d from the walls that reflected off the\ndisco ball overhead. The stage
EXTD= was small and surrounded by a brass rail. As \nscheduled, Brad was lat
EXTD=e while the band March opened the evening. Tom\nand Gwen then did a sho
EXTD=rt set before Brad appeared.\n\nArmed with a beat up acoustic guitar an
EXTD=d countless drink tickets, Brad took \nthe stage. What followed was an 
EXTD=evening of laughs and memories with a man\nwho had the voice from Jah a
EXTD=nd a soul that was true. This recording tries to\ncapture that evening 
EXTD=where Brad displayed the most amazing raw talent in a \nsetting that go
EXTD=t so real sometimes, it blows my mind!\n\nRest In Peace Brad\nWe miss y
